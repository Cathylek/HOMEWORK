   <h3>Students with a growth mindset generally have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. </h3>
   <h3>A study conducted by <span>Dr. Carol Dweck</span> of a group on children, who studied about the brain and how it changes and grow in responds to challenge,shows that these children are much more likely to persevere when they fail. </h3>
   <h3> The most common misunderstanding people have with growth mindset is that,People often confuse a growth mindset with being flexible or open-minded or with having a positive outlook — qualities they believe they have simply always had. </h3>
   <h3 id="red"> Grit is compassion and perserverance for a very long term goal</h3>
   <h3>Grit gives people a mental toughness that enables them to persist — and even succeed — in the face of adversity. For this reason, grit experts such as Duckworth consider grit the single most important personality trait that all high achievers share. This is the evidence that grit is important.</h3>
   <h3>Duckworth and her team found that juniors with the most grit were more likely to graduate from high school than their less gritty peers, even after accounting for these predictive factors, in addition to standardized test scores and demographics.</h3>
